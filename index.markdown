        I am a Research Scientist at Meta. I am building privacy-preserving ML systems for Facebook Ads. I got my Phd in Computer Science at the University of Chicago. I do research on NLP and machine learning. I was very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://aetting.github.io">Prof. Allyson Ettinger</a>. My research focus on composition and interpretability in neural language models.
