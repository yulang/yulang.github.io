    <b>Ph.D. Intern</b>, Jun 2020 - Sep 2020 <BR/>
    Seattle, Washington, United States <BR/><BR/>
    I was on Public connections team, working on "Public Figures to Follow" (PFTF). I built end-to-end pipelines to generate samples and trained multiple deep neural models for user recommendations. Multiple approaches have been experimented targeting at improving user follow through rate.

    <b>Ph.D. Intern</b>, Jun 2019 - Sep 2019 <BR/>
    Seattle, Washington, United States <BR/><BR/>
    I was on page connections team, working on "People You May Follow (PYML)" product. I built end-to-end pipelines for recommendation models, and made multiple iterations on the deep neural models for learning user embedding and page embeddings. I conducted several online A/B test to evaluate the models I trained, and compiled in-depth experiment analysis.

    <b>Intern</b>, Dec 2014 - Jul 2015 <BR/>
    Beijing, Beijing, China <BR/><BR/>
    During the intern, I proposed and implemented a dynamic heterogeneous scheduling framework from scratch, which allows <a href="http://vina.scripps.edu">Autodock Vina</a> (a molecular docking software) to be executed in multi-host concurrent pattern on clusters with CPU + <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/many-integrated-core/intel-many-integrated-core-architecture.html">MIC</a> architecture. Large-scale experiments were performed in Tianhe-2 cluster. This work has been published in the 2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)
