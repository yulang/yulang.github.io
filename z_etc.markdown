## About My Name
The Chinese character of my first name is "浪", which is not very common among Chinese people. It literally means "ocean wave" or "romantic" in Chinese. My last name "余" is a homophone of Chinese character "鱼(fish)". So the two characters of my name make a good combination in Chinese :)

I sometimes go by "Timur". Since my first name "Lang" is not very easy to pronounce, my friends majoring in History came up with this nickname. It comes from ["Timur Lang"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur), who was a Turco-Mongol conqueror and founder of the Timurid Empire. Even though "Lang" means ["lame"](http://www.silk-road.com/artl/timur.shtml) in Persian ("Timur Lang" translates to Timur the Lame), I found the nickname very cool and accepted it.
